# LaserCAM
This is LaserCAM, a simple bit of software to nest DXF files and generate GCODE for a GRBL laser
cutter. It is designed to be as simple as possible and somewhat mimic the Amada VPSS software I use
at work.


## DXF file caveats
We only support lines and assume everything is already flat with no Z variations when rotated into
the XY plane.

### Why only lines?
I use OpenSCAD to model my plywood parts and it apparently only ever exports lines, so this is all
I am supporting for now.


## List of features
- ☐ DXF Loading
- ☐ Recognize lines from line segments
- ☐ Rotate parts if they are not in the XY plane

- ☐ Text GUI

- ☐ Rendering of the build space
- ☐ Rendering of a sheet of material with coloring
- ☐ Line rendering for the model

- ☐ Navigation for the line rendering

- ☐ GCODE output of the nested program

- ☐ Configurable "laser conditions" where the laser operates at different powers
- ☐ Coloring of lines with different laser conditions

- ☐ GCODE simulator with coloring


## DISCLAIMER
This is (at the time of writing) UNTESTED software. The GCODE generated may be wrong, it may be
invalid, and it might just look bad.
