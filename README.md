# LaserCAM
This is LaserCAM, a simple bit of software to nest DXF files and generate GCODE for a GRBL laser
cutter. It is designed to be as simple as possible and somewhat mimic the Amada VPSS software I use
at work.


## Supported DXF features
***TBD***


## DISCLAIMER
This is (at the time of writing) UNTESTED software. The GCODE generated may be wrong, it may be
invalid, and it might just look bad.
